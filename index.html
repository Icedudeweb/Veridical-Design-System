			<h2 class="h2-decorative">Client Description</h2>

			<p>Toolshed is a web-based company that allows users to rent tools of all kinds, from a simple hammer to a pneumatic jackhammer. It aims to democratize handyman projects by making any tool imaginable available at the click of a button. Their image is convenient, reliable, and useful.</p>

			<h2 class="h2-decorative">Why "Veridical?"</h2>

			<p>I chose "veridical" because it sounds innocuous yet strong, and most importantly means something that is truthful and genuine, not illusory or fake. This is exactly the kind of impression I would like my design system to communicate.</p>

			<h2 class="h2-decorative">Identity Keywords</h2>

				<h3 class="h3-decorative">The following keywords describe the look and feel of the client's design system.</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>Bold</li>
						<li>Linear</li>
						<li>Cool</li>
						<li>Clean</li>
						<li>Inspiring</li>
					</ul>
